The general trend i wish to follow is to reflect on topics that i encounter in my day. These topics may be from my discussions with peers, happenings from the day or glitches in my thought process. I would start a post with the topic and leave it till midnight. This will help me gather thoughts and explainations. I believe this would help me write better. 

Today's question is do mediums have a reflective memory. I would like to define medium as anything that supports a conversation between people. It may be programs like WhatsApp, Social networking websites, emails or Virtual Reality spaces. The goal here is to understand if people tend to remember things differently based on mediums. 


Let me think about it and write by tonight. If you have something to contribute feel free to get in touch.

Best,

Rohit
